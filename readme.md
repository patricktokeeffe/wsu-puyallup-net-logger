### Work Requested

* Acquire data from recently installed sensors...
    * many point moisture measurements ([PMM Sensor; SMT Research](https://www.smtresearch.ca/product-page/point-moisture-measurement-sensor-pmm))
    * many embedded moisture sensors ([EMS Sensor; SMT Research](https://www.smtresearch.ca/product-page/embedded-moisture-sensor-ems))
    * a few rel. humidity & temperature sensors ([HTM2500; SMT Research](https://www.smtresearch.ca/product-page/relative-humidity-sensor))
* using existing datalogger infrastructure:
    * (2) microloggers ([CR10X; Campbell Scientific](https://www.campbellsci.com/cr10x))
    * (9) AM16/32A multiplexer ([AM16/32A; Campbell Scientific](https://www.campbellsci.com/am16-32a))
    * (1) datalogger ([CR1000; Campbell Scientific](https://www.campbellsci.com/cr1000))


### Current Status

* [x] Reviewed wiring diagram
    * Identifies possible typos
    * Suggests circuit revision for HTM2500 RH measurements (tie DF input low
      side to earth)
* [x] Wiring diagram reviewed by PI
    * Returned with some edits
* [x] On-site visit by PI
    * Review flagged cells... and update wiring diagram
    * Take photos of installation
    * Positively identify each MUX unit
* [ ] Fix-up sensor hardware integration
    * Per discussion with PI, most sensors are resistive (thermistors)
    * Thermistor-based sensors require additional integration circuity
      &rarr; construct resistor half-bridge
    * Multiplexers designed to read consecutive blocks of identical sensors 
      &rarr; reorganize sensor input locations

A workable approach to thermistor integration:

Notes:
* precision resistor
    * resistive value: 10kOhm is commonly used, reduces impact of lead wire resistance
    * low tolerance: 0.02% (CSI recommended) or 0.1% (spec of Model 107 probe)
    * low temperature coefficient: no more than 5ppm/Â°C (CSI recommended)
* excitation voltage
    * CSI typ uses 2VAC
    * some examples used 0.5V
* temperature polynomial
    * datasheets specify Beta values.. do they also include Steinhart-Hart 
      coefficients?
    * still need to identify "*a, b species correction regression coefficients*"
      mentioned in datasheets
